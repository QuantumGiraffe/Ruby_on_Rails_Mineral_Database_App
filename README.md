# Ruby_on_Rails_Mineral_Database_App
My first web app made with Ruby on Rails. For some time I have been wanting to catalogue my mineral collection. I made this app and I want to build it out to be a database for all the minerals in my collection that will have a picture for each as well as a description and information about it.
